### Eval

**You own the experiment design. Plan, blind, run, synthesize.**

Evals test how a change affects agent behavior before promoting it: a new skill variant, a structural change, a prompt tweak. The failure mode is the observer effect. An agent that knows it's being evaluated behaves differently, so candidates must run blind.

**Non-negotiables for blinding:**

- No `eval`, `test`, `judge`, `experiment`, `rubric`, `score`, `compare`, `benchmark`, `candidate`, or `arena` in any directory, file, or prompt the candidate sees.
- The candidate prompt looks like an organic user request. State the goal, not the meta. "build me a small todo cli" not "show me how you follow the principles chain".
- No chain-eliciting cues. Don't ask the candidate to list which skills, principles, or files they applied; that meta-prompt inflates citation behavior. Ask for design notes generally and grade chain-following from code shape, not self-report.
- Sanitize directory and slug names. Use project-shaped names a user might pick, not labels like `candidate-1` or `agent-a`.
- Don't tell the candidate other candidates exist.
- The judge can know it's judging but sees outputs by sanitized label only, never by model name.
- Comparing two variants: one judge scores both sets in a single pass on one scale, blind to which set each came from. Two judge runs with different prompts don't compare, the calibration drifts.

**Steps:**

1. **Frame.** State what variant is under test and what behavior counts as success. Write the rubric (3-6 concrete criteria) for the judge only. Hold it back from candidates.
2. **Set up sanitized environments.** Per-candidate working dir with the variant in place. Plant any context an organic task would have: a project skeleton, the skills the candidate would naturally read.
3. **Author one organic prompt.** What a user would type. No leakage of what's being measured.
4. **Launch candidates** through **spawn-subagent** per the **arena** skill's Phase B. Use the same neutral prompt and explicitly selected portable skills. Never load **petey-pi** in a native helper. Keep one writer per checkout. Worktrees require explicit user request or approval, so sequence writers otherwise.
5. **Spawn one blinded fresh judge** per the **arena** skill's Phase C. Judge sees outputs by sanitized label and the rubric, never a model name.
6. **Verify the chain from transcripts, not self-report.** Inspect each candidate's recorded Herdr name and pane. Read an exact session transcript only when its location is known. If scrollback truncates the report, ask the child to save that result to a named file. Do not scan session directories across other workspaces; that crosses project boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects. Look at which files each candidate actually opened. Citing a principle is not reading its leaf skill, and reading it is not applying it. Grade chain-following from the files it really read plus the shape of the code, never from the candidate's own claims.
7. **Read every candidate output yourself** end to end. Compare to the judge's verdict. Disagreement means a model is biased or the rubric is ambiguous. Synthesize.

**Reply:** variant under test, rubric, per-candidate notes, judge's verdict, your synthesis, and a recommendation for whether to promote the variant.
