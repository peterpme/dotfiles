### Worktree and simulator cleanup

**You own the disk and the safety gate.** Prune merged or abandoned git worktrees and stale iOS simulators to reclaim space. Deletion is irreversible, so every step guards against deleting something in use or holding uncommitted work.

1. Snapshot and audit. Record `df -h /`, then run `scripts/worktree-audit.sh` (principle-build-the-lever). It reads paths from `git worktree list`, never hand-typed, since hand-typed paths miss worktrees created under tool-managed directories (principle-encode-lessons-in-structure). It classifies each worktree by size, age, merge state, uncommitted work, PR state, and the newest chat that touched it, then suggests a bucket. The transcript scan is slow, so background it.
2. The bucket is advice, not permission. The pinned and active chats are the real artifact (principle-prove-it-works). Get that set from the user and active Pi session and recorded Herdr names and panes, then cross-check every candidate. The lever has marked `safe` a worktree the user had pinned, so the pinned set wins.
3. Verify usage before deleting. For every `verify-recent-chat` row, or anything you doubt, use **spawn-subagent** under [the delegation contract](../../../docs/subagents.md) for scoped transcript-reading briefs with no edits or further delegation. Require evidence of whether each chat is ongoing and which worktrees it uses. Check recorded Herdr panes too. A quiet or unnamed worktree may still have an active writer.
4. Pause on irreversible loss. `wip:N` is N tracked uncommitted edits. Show the diff and get a decision first, since removing a clean worktree is recoverable from its branch but uncommitted work is gone. `scratch:N` is untracked throwaway, safe to drop, but name the files. Per Autonomy, clean and merged and not-in-use proceeds; `wip` and in-use pause.
5. Prune the confirmed set. Per path, `git worktree remove --force <path>`; if the dir survives on ignored build artifacts, `rm -rf` it, then `git worktree prune`. Branch refs survive, so no commits are lost. Confirm with `df -h /` and re-list.
6. Simulators and other reclaimers. Simulators are usually the next-biggest win. `xcrun simctl --set testing delete all` (XCTestDevices clones), `xcrun simctl delete unavailable`, and `xcrun simctl runtime list` then `runtime delete <id>` for old runtimes. More when needed: Xcode `DerivedData` and `iOS DeviceSupport`; package caches such as pnpm, uv, brew, and yarn. Clear only caches the user has not said to keep.

This is the one playbook that deletes user state with no code review to catch a slip, so the gates above are the review.

**Reply:** `df -h /` before and after with space reclaimed, the worktrees pruned, and a one-line reason for each held back (in-use by which chat, or uncommitted work).
